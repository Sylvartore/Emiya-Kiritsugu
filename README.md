# A STRONG Abalone playing AI agent

[Abalone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone_(board_game) "Wiki Abalone") is a rather complicated board game.

This project builds a strong Abalone playing AI named Emiya-Kiritsugu that won the 2019 Abalone ULTIMATE Champion against other AI agents.

After the final match with another agent, 5 human players were invited to play against Emiya-Kiritsugu in such rule: 

human player takes 20 seconds per turn vs AI player takes 5 seconds per turn

Emiya-Kiritsugu won the 6 out of total 6 games.
